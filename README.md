## Introduction
Forest fires are a major environmental concern, causing extensive damage to biodiversity, property, and human lives. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict fire severity using meteorological and forest-related indices. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help forest management teams preemptively allocate resources and mitigate fire risks.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises **244 instances** of weather data and forest fire observations collected from two Algerian regions: **Bejaia** and **Sidi Bel Abbes**. Key attributes include:

- **Weather Features**: Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, and Rainfall.
- **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**: Indicators like Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Drought Code (DC), and Initial Spread Index (ISI).
- **Outcome**: Binary classes representing fire occurrence (`fire` and `not fire`).

---

## Data Cleaning
To ensure data quality, we performed the following steps:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Removed rows with missing or anomalous data points.
2. **Region Encoding**: Added a new `Region` column for classification (`0` for Bejaia and `1` for Sidi Bel Abbes).
3. **Column Renaming and Type Conversion**: Standardized column names and converted data types for consistency.
4. **Header Removal**: Eliminated redundant headers embedded within the dataset.

### Final Dataset
The cleaned dataset includes **243 rows** and **13 columns** with no null values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA revealed critical patterns in fire occurrence and its relationship with weather conditions:

1. **Fire Distribution**:
   - **Pie Chart**: A balanced distribution of fire (`56.5%`) and no-fire (`43.5%`) cases.
   - **Classes Visualization**: [Insert Pie Chart Placeholder]

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Strong correlations observed between `FWI`, `DC`, and `DMC`.
   - **Heatmap**: [Insert Correlation Heatmap Placeholder]

3. **Monthly Trends**:
   - August and September recorded the highest fire occurrences across both regions.
   - **Monthly Fire Analysis**: [Insert Bar Chart Placeholder]

4. **Box Plots**:
   - Significant outliers in `FWI` and `Temperature` suggesting critical thresholds for fire risk.
   - **Boxplot Visualization**: [Insert Box Plot Placeholder]

### Insights:
- The `FWI` index serves as a reliable predictor for fire severity.
- Seasonal trends indicate increased fire activity during dry months.

---

## Feature Engineering
1. **Target Variable**:
   - Fire severity (`Classes`) encoded as binary values (`1` for fire, `0` for no fire).
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Removed highly correlated features (`>0.87 correlation threshold`) to mitigate multicollinearity.

---

## Model Development
We implemented and compared multiple regression models to predict the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**, a crucial indicator of fire severity.

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Baseline model with reasonable accuracy.
   - **Metrics**: [Insert MAE and R² Placeholder]

2. **Lasso and Ridge Regression**:
   - Improved performance through regularization.
   - **Metrics**: [Insert Comparative Metrics Placeholder]

3. **ElasticNet Regression**:
   - Combined benefits of Lasso and Ridge, yielding robust predictions.
   - **Cross-Validation Results**: [Insert ElasticNet CV Metrics Placeholder]

### Feature Scaling:
- Standardized features to improve model convergence and accuracy.
- **Scaling Visualization**: [Insert Before vs After Box Plot Placeholder]

## Results and Insights
1. **Key Metrics**:
   - **MAE**: [Insert MAE Placeholder]
   - **R²**: [Insert R² Placeholder]
2. **Model Comparison**:
   - ElasticNet CV emerged as the best model with minimal error and high generalizability.

3. **Business Insights**:
   - Regions with high `FWI` values require proactive monitoring during dry seasons.
   - Resource allocation can be optimized by focusing on August and September, as identified by the monthly analysis.

---

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict fire severity in forest regions. By identifying high-risk periods and regions, forest management teams can take preemptive measures to minimize losses.

---

## Future Scope
1. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Incorporate additional weather features like atmospheric pressure or soil moisture for improved accuracy.
2. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - Map high-risk areas using GIS tools.
3. **Real-Time Predictions**:
   - Deploy models on IoT-enabled weather stations for dynamic monitoring.
