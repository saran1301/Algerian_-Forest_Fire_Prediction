## Introduction
Forest fires are a major environmental concern, causing extensive damage to biodiversity, property, and human lives. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict fire severity using meteorological and forest-related indices. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help forest management teams preemptively allocate resources and mitigate fire risks.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises **244 instances** of weather data and forest fire observations collected from two Algerian regions: **Bejaia** and **Sidi Bel Abbes**. Key attributes include:

- **Weather Features**: Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, and Rainfall.
- **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**: Indicators like Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Drought Code (DC), and Initial Spread Index (ISI).
- **Outcome**: Binary classes representing fire occurrence (`fire` and `not fire`).

---

## Data Cleaning
To ensure data quality, we performed the following steps:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Removed rows with missing or anomalous data points.
2. **Region Encoding**: Added a new `Region` column for classification (`0` for Bejaia and `1` for Sidi Bel Abbes).
3. **Column Renaming and Type Conversion**: Standardized column names and converted data types for consistency.
4. **Header Removal**: Eliminated redundant headers embedded within the dataset.

### Final Dataset
The cleaned dataset includes **243 rows** and **13 columns** with no null values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA revealed critical patterns in fire occurrence and its relationship with weather conditions:

1. **Fire Distribution**:
   - **Pie Chart**: A balanced distribution of fire (`56.5%`) and no-fire (`43.5%`) cases.
   - **Classes Visualization**: ![image](https://github.com/saran1301/Algerian_Forest_Fire_Prediction/blob/9812c900bf6277110830688456d1af00ee27fd3b/src/Visualisations/Pie%20Chart%20of%20Classes.png)

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Strong correlations observed between `FWI`, `DC`, and `DMC`.
   - **Plots** :

3. **Monthly Trends**:
   - August and September recorded the highest fire occurrences across both regions.

### Insights:
- The `FWI` index serves as a reliable predictor for fire severity.
- Seasonal trends indicate increased fire activity during dry months.

## Feature Engineering
1. **Target Variable**:
   - Fire severity (`Classes`) encoded as binary values (`1` for fire, `0` for no fire).
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Removed highly correlated features (`>0.87 correlation threshold`) to mitigate multicollinearity.

---

## Feature Scaling:
- Standardized features to improve model convergence and accuracy.
- **Scaling Visualization**: ![image](https://github.com/saran1301/Algerian_Forest_Fire_Prediction/blob/9812c900bf6277110830688456d1af00ee27fd3b/src/Visualisations/Feature%20Scaling.png)
